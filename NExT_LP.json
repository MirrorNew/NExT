        "question": "Located under the shade of sycamore trees in the old city, Changning District People's Hospital has been a trusted medical center for surrounding residents for decades. With the aging of the population and the opening of the two-child policy, the number of outpatient visits and hospitalization needs have increased year by year, especially in the pediatric and emergency departments, which are often overcrowded. Head nurse Lin Mei has worked in this hospital for 15 years. She arrives at work at five in the morning every day to check the shift schedule and coordinate emergencies - for example, Xiao Li, who worked the night shift yesterday, suddenly had a fever, and twins were born in the obstetrics department in the early morning. She knows that scheduling is not just a table, but also about patient safety and the morale of the nursing team: newcomers need to be mentored by old staff, pregnant women cannot work night shifts, and nurses who work around the clock are prone to mistakes... But the hospital budget is limited, and human resource costs must be carefully calculated. Under the premise of meeting the demand for nurses in each time period, design an efficient and humane scheduling plan to avoid overwork or waste of manpower, and reserve flexible space for emergencies. \n\nPeople's Hospital is a district-level hospital in Changning District. The number of nurses on duty required in each time period of the hospital every day is shown in Table C-2. \n\nTable C-2\n\n| Time period | 6:00-10:00 | 10:00-14:00 | 14:00-18:00 | 18:00-22:00 | 22:00-6:00 (next day) |\n| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- |\n| Number of nurses required | 18 | 20 | 19 | 17 | 12 |\n\nThe nurses in this hospital work in five shifts, each 8 hours. The specific working hours are 2:00-10:00 for the first shift, 6:00-14:00 for the second shift, 10:00-18:00 for the third shift, 14:00-22:00 for the fourth shift, and 18:00-2:00 (next day). Each nurse works 5 shifts per week and is assigned to different days. There is a chief nurse who is responsible for the nurses' duty arrangements and duty plans, which should be relatively economical in terms of personnel or economy, and as reasonable as possible. It is the duty plan:\n\n**Plan**: Each nurse works for 5 consecutive days, rests for 2 days, and is arranged from the first shift to the fifth shift from the first day of work. For example, if a nurse starts working on Monday, she will work the first shift on Monday, the second shift on Tuesday... the fifth shift on Friday; if another nurse starts working on Wednesday, she will work the first shift on Wednesday, the second shift on Thursday... the fifth shift on Sunday, and so on.\n\nEstablish a linear programming model to minimize the number of nurses on duty. You only need to give the minimum number of nurses. ",

        "question": "**Scenario background:** \n\nSunshine Machinery Factory is a medium-sized manufacturing enterprise with a history of 30 years. It is located between the mottled factory buildings in the old industrial area and specializes in the OEM and R&D of precision parts. In recent years, with the explosive growth of new energy vehicles and automation equipment, the factory's orders have surged, but the problem of equipment aging has become increasingly prominent, and it is necessary to rely on existing resources to \"squeeze\" the maximum production capacity. Under the hard constraint of monthly equipment maintenance, the optimal production plan for January to June is formulated to reasonably allocate the production volume of 7 products to ensure balanced equipment load, timely delivery of orders, and maximize total profits. During the process, production scheduling needs to be adjusted dynamically. For example, when the horizontal drill is repaired in February, products that do not rely on the equipment (such as Type II) are given priority, and the relationship between high-profit products and equipment occupancy rate is weighed.\n\nThe factory has 4 grinders, 2 vertical drills, 3 horizontal drills, 1 boring machine and 1 planer, which are used to produce 7 products. The relevant equipment hours required for various products of the production unit and their profits are shown in Table C-3\n\nTable C-3 Unit Required Equipment\n\n| Equipment\\(Unit hours required)\\Product | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII |\n| ------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Grinding machine | 0.5 | 0.7 | — | — | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.5 |\n| Vertical drill | 0.1 | 0.2 | — | 0.3 | — | 0.6 | — |\n| Horizontal drill | 0.2 | — | 0.8 | — | — | — | 0.6 |\n| Boring machine | 0.05 | 0.03 | — | 0.07 | 0.1 | — | 0.08 |\n| Planer | — | — | 0.01 | — | 0.05 | — | 0.05 |\n| **Profit per piece/yuan** | 100 | 60 | 80 | 40 | 110 | 90 | 30 |\n\nFrom January to June, the following equipment needs to be repaired: January - 1 grinder, February - 2 horizontal drills, March - 1 boring machine, April - 1 vertical drill, May - 1 grinder and 1 vertical drill, June - 1 planer and 1 horizontal drill. The repaired equipment cannot be arranged for production within the month\n\nIt is also known that the maximum market demand for the above 7 products from January to June is shown in Table C-4\n\nTable C-4\n\n| Month | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| January | 500 | 1000 | 300 | 300 | 800 | 200 | 100 |\n| January | 600 | 500 | 200 | 0 | 400 | 300 | 150 |\n| March | 300 | 600 | 0 | 0 | 500 | 400 | 100 |\n| April | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 200 | 0 | 100 |\n| May | 0 | 100 | 500 | 100 | 1000 | 300 | 0 |\n| June | 500 | 500 | 100 | 300 | 1100 | 500 | 60 |\n\nThe monthly storage fee for each product that cannot be sold in the month is 5 yuan, but the storage volume of each product shall not exceed 100 pieces at any time. There is no inventory at the beginning of January, and it is required to store 50 pieces of each product at the end of June. If the factory works 24 days a month, two shifts a day, and each shift is 8 hours, assuming that the processing order of the products on various equipment is not considered, how should the factory arrange the plan to maximize the total profit?

        "question": "Ethiopian Adama Chemical Company (hereinafter referred to as **EAC**) was established in 1998. It was originally just a small ammonium nitrate workshop. Now it has developed into a regional leading enterprise integrating R&D, production, warehousing and international trade. The company's plant is close to the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway trunk line and is only 72 kilometers away from the nearest inland port **Modjo Dry Port**; this logistics advantage is said to be one of the decisive factors in the board of directors' decision to build the plant. EAC's corporate vision is written on a blue plaque with white letters at the gate: \"**Better Chemistry, Better Future**\". According to internal communications, the company also plans to put into operation a 5 MW photovoltaic power station in 2026 to offset the pressure of carbon tax, but this project is not directly related to this question.\n\nThe Ethiopian Chemical Company is located in Adama and produces a variety of chemical products such as fertilizers, coatings and industrial chemicals. In 2025, the chemical company plans to formulate a production plan for the next two quarters. The company operates three core products: fertilizers (Product F), coatings (Product P) and industrial chemicals (Product C). Affected by the fluctuations in the international raw material market, local labor regulations, and equipment energy consumption tax policies, the company's management requires that the production schedule of the three main production lines be re-optimized while ensuring continuous supply and profitability. \n\nIn recent years, the local rainy season (June-September) has been advanced or extended many times, resulting in delays in the land transportation of ore raw materials; in addition, the Ethiopian Central Bank has implemented stricter approval for foreign exchange allocations, which has also lengthened the supply cycle of imported additives. At the same time, the gradual implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has opened up new markets in East Africa and Southern Africa for the company, which can be said to be both an opportunity and a challenge. At the mid-term review meeting for fiscal year 2025, management decided that it was necessary to review internal production scheduling to ensure that the two core goals of **continuous supply** and **maximum profitability** remain resilient in the \"changing external environment.\" \n\nIn terms of time, within the plan, the company has locked in ten suppliers, each of which can supply up to 500 Tons of a certain nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium composite raw material, the excess cannot be effectively produced. In terms of equipment, historical safety records show that each main reactor is only allowed to be started up for a total of 125 days within the planned time; this quarter is operated at full capacity in double shifts (40 hours per shift), and no more than 3,000 tons of each product is allowed to avoid overproduction. In terms of manpower, there are 80 front-line operators, and the net working hours that each person can arrange on the production line in this plan shall not exceed 100 hours, and the rest of the time must be used for maintenance, training and rotation. In terms of the market, based on the sales department's tracking of domestic and foreign orders, the potential demand for fertilizers, coatings, and chemicals shall not exceed 2,000 tons, 1,500 tons, and 1,800 tons, respectively. The excess cannot be digested within the quarter. Upon investigation, during the planned time, the company's contract with customers requires that fertilizers must account for at least 25% of the total output (to ensure basic agricultural orders). At the same time, due to the signing of a framework agreement with a large customer, at least 1,000 tons must be provided. Tons of paint. In actual production, due to the high cost of switching the coolant of the device, the production volume of chemicals cannot exceed 0.8 times that of fertilizers (otherwise the equipment is overloaded), and nitrogen plays a dominant role in the raw materials. It is stipulated that the average raw material consumption per ton of product in production cannot exceed 0.65 tons. In order to enhance the brand image, all exported fertilizers must be packaged in newly designed biodegradable bags, but the packaging workshop has sufficient production capacity and does not constitute a bottleneck for the time being. In addition, the company will donate 1% of its profits to the local community fund every month to support vocational schools. Currently, this expenditure has been deducted from the profit coefficient. The cost data after deduction is shown in the following table, \n\n| Product | Profit/ton (US dollars) | Raw materials/ton (tons) | Machine time/ton (hours) | Labor/ton (hours) |\n| ------ | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |\n| Fertilizer | 200 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 0.6 |\n| Paint | 300 | 0.7 | 1.0 | 0.8 |\n| Chemicals | 250 | 0.6 | 0.9 | 0.7 |\n\nIn summary, choose the appropriate output of fertilizers, paints, and chemicals to maximize the total profit while satisfying the constraints. Only the maximum total profit needs to be given. ",

        "question": "Malaysia United Chemical Trading Co., Ltd. is a company focusing on the import and export of polymer materials. The company has a complete transportation network in Southeast Asia and maintains long-term cooperation with multiple ports, storage centers and logistics partners. The company currently operates four polyvinyl chloride polymer production plants P1-P4, which are located on different islands. In order to meet the needs of customers in many places in the region, it is necessary to transport products to four major demand locations, namely D1-D4, by land and sea. In order to ensure that the company maintains its cost advantage in the fierce market competition, the logistics department is seeking a set of methods that can minimize transportation costs while meeting the resources and contract constraints of all parties. The overall goal is to reasonably dispatch the shipments of each factory under the premise of the existing transportation network and resource capacity, to ensure that the needs of customers in various places are met on time, and to control the total transportation cost to the minimum. \n\nRecently, due to the limited amount of polyvinyl chloride polymers that can be provided by the four factories every day, the production capacity of each factory is closely related to the supply of raw materials. If the daily shipment volume of the factory exceeds its own production capacity, it will cause production plan conflicts. It is necessary to ensure that the total shipment volume of each factory does not exceed its supply capacity. On the demand side, each demand location is a local large-scale pipe manufacturer, and the downstream order volume is rigid. If the shipment volume is lower than the actual demand, it will lead to a breach of contract. Fines are incurred, so it must be ensured that the total volume of goods received by each demand location is not less than its actual demand. In terms of transportation, the transportation network consists of land trunk lines and ocean liners. The transportation costs and times of different routes vary significantly. In order to avoid the safety and insurance risks caused by excessive use of a single route, the transportation volume from each factory to the demand location should follow the maximum carrying capacity of the line and shall not exceed 2,000 tons. In addition, the company’s first factory P1 signed an agreement with its largest customer D1, requiring at least 300 units of goods, and the company’s fourth factory P4 signed an agreement with customer D1, requiring at least 200 units of goods to be shipped directly from the designated factory to the customer’s location. In order to maintain a long-term cooperative relationship. In addition, part of the shipment to D3 is a high-priority order jointly developed with a third-party brand. The company's internal agreement stipulates that at least 20% of D3's demand must be jointly undertaken by P2 and P3 factories to ensure the stability of supply to key customers. In order to support the development of the southern market, the volume of goods shipped by P4 factory to southern locations (D2 and D3) must account for more than 70% of its total shipments, while the volume of goods shipped by P2 factory to southern locations must be less than 50% of its total shipments to fulfill its cooperation commitment to the local government. Only the lowest total transportation cost needs to be given. \n\nThe data table is as follows:\n\n| Factory | Penang Factory P1 | Kuala Lumpur Factory P2 | Ipoh Factory P3 | Malacca Factory P4 |\n| ---- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |\n| Supply | 1000 | 1500 | 1200 | 800 |\n\n| Demand Location | Butterworth Transit Terminal D1 | Kuantan Manufacturing Park D2 | Klang Chemical Park D3 | Muar Distribution Center D4 |\n| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |\n| Demand | 900 | 1100 | 1000 | 500 |\n\n| Transportation Cost | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4 |\n| -------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| P1 | 10 | 15 | 12 | 20 |\n| P2 | 14 | 13 | 16 | 18 |\n| P3 | 12 | 17 | 11 | 15 |\n| P4 | 19 | 14 | 18 | 13 |",

The company operates several intelligent greenhouse factories and cooperates deeply with the local transportation network to realize the closed-loop supply chain management of \"field-factory-market\". The company is careful in the input of resources such as land, irrigation, and labor, and predicts market demand and cost fluctuations through big data. In order to maximize profits and meet sustainable development goals, it is exploring a land allocation optimization solution based on linear programming. The overall goal is to scientifically allocate the planting area of ​​seven major crops on the premise of ensuring the rational use of resources and rigid market demand to maximize total profits. Nonglian tried to introduce drone sprinkler technology in 2019, which can increase water resource utilization to 150%, but it was eventually abandoned due to unstable rainy season.\n\n In terms of resources, the total available farmland area is 7 hectares, of which block A is 5 hectares and block B is 2 hectares, and green corn, cabbage and tomatoes can only be planted in block A. The irrigation water source is limited to 5,000 cubic meters, and the total labor force is 400 people, with an average of 10 hours of work per person. These three types of resources need to be reasonably allocated among the seven crops to avoid idle or overloaded resources. In terms of the market, the maximum sales demand for each crop is different. If this upper limit is exceeded, there will be a risk of unsalable products. Therefore, the planting area of ​​each crop should not exceed its maximum demand. In terms of operating costs, the cultivation costs and per hectare of different crops are different. Profits vary from hectare to hectare, and it is necessary to take into account cost consumption while pursuing high profits to prevent excessive cost investment. In terms of diversity, the company hopes to plant at least 6 or more crops (if planted, the crops must be planted on at least 0.8 hectares) to diversify market risks. At the same time, it is required that the planting area of ​​melons (pumpkins) and roots (sweet potatoes) be balanced to optimize product structure.

Relying on the transportation network covering the southern region, the company implements the four-level inventory and distribution management of \"factory-central warehouse-regional warehouse-retail store\". In order to cope with market fluctuations and cost pressures, the company's logistics and operations team hopes to optimize ordering and transportation decisions through periodic review strategies, and minimize ordering costs, holding costs and transportation costs within a total of 15 cycles while ensuring that each store is constantly stocked, and reasonably utilize inventory resources.\n\nOn the supply side, in each cycle, regional warehouses can choose to place orders separately to request replenishment and replenishment quantities from the central warehouse. At the same time, regional warehouses can redistribute inventory to various retail stores. The ordering cost must be fixed and the replenishment quantity must be received immediately after a single order is placed. If an order is not placed with the central warehouse, the regional warehouse cannot obtain the new inventory. In addition, the central warehouse does not need to increase inventory. \n\nIn terms of demand, the four retail stores have certain sales needs in each cycle. If the inventory cannot meet the demand, there will be a risk of out-of-stock. It is necessary to ensure that the inventory level of each store in each period is non-negative, and It is necessary to ensure that each store maintains a safety stock of more than 30% of demand at the end of each period to cope with sudden increases in demand. \n\nIn terms of transportation, the transportation volume from the central warehouse to the regional warehouse and from the regional warehouse to the retail store is limited by the vehicle capacity.

        "question": " ABC Insurance Company, as a comprehensive financial services group, has a dedicated policy printing factory and several regional distribution centers. The company relies on a nationwide transportation network to deliver tens of thousands of policy materials to local sales teams in a timely manner. The entire operation is inseparable from the fine control and scheduling of costs/resources. The group's senior management hopes to optimize policy allocation and production decisions through operations research models to meet customer needs and maintain market competitiveness under the premise of controlling total costs.\n\n On the supply side, the company needs to place production orders to three printing factories A, B, and C each period. Each printing factory is responsible for a fixed type of insurance policy, that is, there are three types of insurance policies, A, B, and C. The company wants to minimize the sum of deductibles and other costs. Please determine the expected number of customers for each plan to decide how many insurance policies should be printed.Different plans will incur fixed startup costs, and the startup costs of different plans are different. According to past experience, if a plan has a customer assigned, the startup costs of plans A, B, and C are US$50, US$55, and US$40 respectively. \n\nIn terms of demand, there are about 600 customers from ten cities in each city waiting to be assigned insurance plans. The specific values ​​are shown in the table below. Each period must meet this total amount and ensure that the average deductible does not exceed US$1,100 to maintain the attractiveness of the product. \n\nIn terms of transportation, the company uses the national transportation network to transport the insurance policies shipped by the printing factory to the regional distribution centers and sales outlets in batches. Since the company sends its own vehicle, the transportation cost can be ignored. \n\nAt the same time, in order to ensure service coverage and financial balance, the total premium income for the whole year must reach at least US$1 million to trigger the bonus distribution mechanism. \n\nIn terms of age segmentation, the company divides the total customers into age groups based on the differences in health risks of customers. It is divided into six categories: 0-6 years old, 6-12 years old, 12-18 years old, 18-35 years old, 35-65 years old, and 65-100 years old. The premiums for different age groups remain the same, but the deductible doctor's consultation fees and specialist doctor's fees will fluctuate slightly on the original basis to more accurately reflect the claims and usage costs of each age group. In order to ensure that all plans have sufficient penetration in the main young market, the proportion of customers in the 18-35 age group must not be less than 25% of all customers in Plan A, the proportion of customers in Plan B must not be less than 30%, and the proportion of customers in Plan C must not be less than 20%.And all the sub-quotas and ages in all cities must have at least 1/60 of the city's population, rounded down.

        "question": "In eastern Mexico, there is an energy company called \"Orissa Electric Holding Company\". The company owns 17 power plants distributed along the coast and inland. These plants include various types of machines such as bioenergy, combined cycle, wind energy, hydropower, solar energy and coal-fired. In order to ensure the stability of regional power supply, the company not only manages the power generation resources of each power plant, but also coordinates the fuel transportation network, transporting biomass fuel and natural gas to each plant through land pipelines and special fleets, and at the same time, transmitting electricity to substations in major cities through its own high-voltage transmission lines. The whole process involves maintaining a large amount of equipment, paying transportation costs and resource scheduling fees. The company's overall goal is to organize power generation and transmission at the lowest total cost while meeting the ever-changing power demand in four time periods. The eastern coastal area of ​​Mexico holds an annual The traditional hot air balloon festival is held, but it has no direct relationship with power dispatch. The agave planting industry in the coastal area is very developed, and some wind farms used to be large agave farms. The exterior walls of some local power plants are decorated with Mayan-style reliefs. \n\nOn the supply side, each power plant must meet the minimum and maximum output requirements of its units at any time, and can only generate electricity when the unit is in the on state. At the same time, each time the unit is turned on or off, fixed costs, startup costs and shutdown costs must be paid to maintain the life and safety of the equipment. If the power changes, change costs must also be paid for the changed power value. Change cost refers to the difference in the changed power value that needs to be calculated if the output power is changed when the unit switches to operate in different time periods (Assume that the difference in the first period is equal to the output power of that period minus 0, as all machines are initially turned off before first period). \n\nOn the demand side, the system needs to be based on the time period within four 6-hour periods. The demands of 1, 2, 3, and 4 need greater than 11832.52, 14467.92, 16661.10, and 15434.44 MWh, respectively. Otherwise, they will have to bear high fines or activate backup power due to power shortages. \n\nIn terms of transportation, all power generation is delivered from the factory to substations in various regions through the company's self-built transmission network. The loss during transmission is negligible and will not affect the balance of supply and demand. \n\nAt the same time, in order to reduce the frequent start and stop of units, if a Combined Cycle unit is running in any period, it must continue to run in the next period to avoid additional wear and tear. At the same time, the total number of units running in the system must not be less than eight to ensure network diversity and emergency backup capacity. Assume that all machines are initially turned off,You can choose whether to open it in the first period.

The company owns three generators with different technical characteristics. Through a complete power transmission network, the electric energy is transmitted to multiple substations in the region and finally delivered to users. The dispatching team needs to flexibly use the capacity and ramp-up/downhill capability of each unit to control operating costs and resource consumption while meeting load demand. The overall goal is to minimize the total power generation cost and reasonably allocate the limited power generation and transmission resources in the power grid through scientific start-stop and output decisions under the premise of ensuring the reliability of the power grid.\nIn terms of units, each generator set must bear the minimum stable output when it is started and must not exceed its rated maximum output. The start-stop status and output level are coupled with each other and need to be decided synchronously. In order to ensure that unit 3 has a maintenance opportunity, unit 3 is required to be shut down for maintenance at least once within the five-hour dispatch period. In terms of demand, the load demands of the four substations in the five time periods are different. It is necessary to ensure that the power demands of all substations in each time period are accurately met to avoid the risk of power outages. In terms of the dispatching network, the output change of each unit in adjacent time periods shall not exceed its climbing or descending limit, and each unit can supply power to at most two substations in the same time period. If the same substation is supplied for three consecutive time periods, it shall not be supplied to the substation in the next time period to improve the system fault tolerance.

        "question": "Shengrui Supply Chain Technology Company plans to launch a 12-phase strategic project investment plan in the new year, with the goal of gradually advancing its six key projects, covering logistics platform construction, intelligent warehousing transformation, new algorithm research and development and other fields. There is a strong dependence and phased incentive mechanism between projects. The company hopes to maximize the cumulative profit for the whole year through reasonable phased investment. Due to the tight funds and human resources, the company headquarters has formulated a unified constraint framework: the budget for each period is up to 40 million yuan, the upper limit of human resources is 18 people, and the resource allocation of all projects must comply with the corresponding logical restrictions. At the same time, in order to encourage early investment, the company has set up a phased \"investment incentive\" policy. If a specific number of projects are completed within a certain period, additional incentives will be obtained in subsequent periods, such as cost discounts or additional project unlocking rights. The company's executive level plans to build a set of full-year investment plans to determine which projects should be selected in each period to meet the requirement that all projects are implemented at least once throughout the year, and at the same time make full use of incentive policies to pursue the maximization of annual profits within budget and human resources constraints.\n\nIn terms of supply, The maximum investment per phase is 40 million yuan, and the total human resources is no more than 18 people. Exceeding this limit will be a violation. There are 12 phases in a year, but resources can be reset in each phase. \n\nIn terms of demand, the investment income of each project is one-time (that is, if you invest in a certain phase, you will get the profit of that phase). Each implementation requires reinvesting the cost and human resources of the project, and the previous remaining resources cannot be accumulated. \n\nIn terms of investment logic, if Project 3 and Project 6 are selected at the same time at a certain stage, the R&D cost of Project 3 in the next phase will be halved due to the synergy of development timeliness, but will be restored to its original price afterwards. This cost change has no effect on profits, only on cost investment. \n\nIn terms of project unlocking incentives, If Project 1 is selected 3 times, Project 2 is selected 2 times, and Project 3 is selected once throughout the year, after all three conditions are met, in each subsequent period, the company can select an additional implementation project (i.e., any one of Projects 4, 5, and 6), and its cost is 0.7 times the original cost, and the company can send additional people to help, without satisfying human resource constraints. However, it still cannot violate the constraint that Project 4 and Project 5 cannot be implemented at the same time in the same period. \n\nIn terms of project dependency and exclusivity, in any period, if Project 2 is selected, Project 1 must be selected at the same time, otherwise the implementation of Project 2 will fail; and Project 4 and Project 5 cannot be implemented at the same time in the same period; throughout the year, Project 3 and Project 6 must be selected at least once to ensure the achievement of the strategic expansion task. \n\nIn terms of selection restrictions, A maximum of 4 projects can be selected in each period (if the project incentive is unlocked, a maximum of 4+1 projects can be selected). Each period contains at least 1 R&D project and at most 2 R&D projects (projects 1, 2, and 3 belong to the R&D category) to prevent R&D investment from getting out of control. \n\nIn terms of annual goals, each project is required to be selected at least once in the 12 periods of the year (that is, the cumulative number of selections for each project throughout the year ≥ 1). Only the calculated profit needs to be given. \n\n| Project No. | Project Category | Cost (million yuan) | Profit (million yuan) | Manpower Requirements (people) |\n| -------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |\n| Project 1 | R&D | 10 | 8 | 4 |\n| Project 2 | R&D | 15 | 12 | 6 |\n| Project 3 | R&D | 8 | 7 | 3 |\n| Project 4 | Implementation | 20 | 15 | 8 |\n| Project 5 | Implementation | 11 | 9 | 5 |\n| Project 6 | Implementation | 9 | 8 | 4 |",

        "question": "Dongjiang Communication Group is the largest urban network operator in South China. In recent years, due to the expansion of 5G business, it needs to restructure the base station layout in the core urban area. The company plans to select eight candidate sites in Fenghuang New City to build base stations to form an efficient cellular network. The area contains 10 high-density user areas (numbered 1-10), and each area has different coverage priorities due to differences in population density and commercial value. Due to municipal planning restrictions, base station facilities must be compatible with underground optical cable transportation network nodes, and the total construction budget is 160(unit: ten thousand yuan). The engineering team needs to design the optimal site plan for all coverage efficiency areas while meeting the signal superposition redundancy requirements. \n\n**Supply side**, candidate base station sites have heterogeneous deployment conditions. The optical cable interface capacity of sites 1-8 is the same, but due to the approval of municipal land use, a maximum of 5 sites can be selected for construction, with an average construction period of 1 year. **Demand side**, the coverage benefit weights of each user area have been calculated through census data and commercial traffic models, among which area 10 has the highest priority due to the presence of a cross-border logistics data center. Signal coverage depends on the topological relationship between base stations and user areas as described in the table. For example, site 1 can radiate areas 1, 2, and 5 at the same time, and the signal of site 6 can penetrate the subway tunnel structure of areas 5, 7, 8, and 10. The same is true for other areas. **Additional constraints**, engineering specifications require that if a area is covered by multiple base stations, its coverage benefit is still calculated as a single coverage, and the coverage status of each area must strictly correspond to the deployment of its service base station. In addition, historical data shows that there is an electromagnetic interference risk between areas 8, 9, and 10, which needs to be carefully evaluated and can be covered by at most one base station. \n\nThe cost of each base station includes the cost of infrastructure construction and the cost of population service. The population service cost is designed to cover all base stations in the area, and the basic population service cost is 0.5 yuan/person. If an area is covered by multiple base stations at the same time, the population service fee will be diluted by multiple base stations on average because the network information is spread to each base station. At the same time, if there is a subway in a certain area, it may be necessary to build additional subway coverage equipment (the cost of this equipment is 1, unit: ten thousand yuan) during construction. This equipment can further reduce the total basic population service cost of the area by 0.1 yuan/person. \n\n It is required that all areas be covered and the total cost be provided. \n\nData table \n\n**Table 1: Base station coverage relationship** \n\n| Base station number | Coverable user area number | Base station construction cost |\n| -------- | -------------------- | ------------ |\n| 1 | 1,2,5 | 27 |\n| 2 | 2,3,6 | 25 |\n| 3 | 1,4,7 | 25 |\n| 4 | 3,5,6,7 | 30 |\n| 5 | 4,6,8,9 | 30 |\n| 6 | 5,7,8,10 | 30 |\n| 7 | 8,9,10 | 25 |\n| 8 | 9,10 | 20 |\n\n**Table 2: User area situation (Unit: ten thousand people)** \n\n| Area number | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n| ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Population | 4 | 8 | 5 | 10 | 12 | 7 | 9 | 3 | 6 | 11 |\n| Is there a subway? | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |",

        "question": "China-Europe Cold Chain Logistics Co., Ltd. has built a \"one-stop processing center for pre-prepared meals\" in Chongqing Liangjiang New District. The core of the center is three parallel deep processing lines, called \"Line A\", \"Line B\" and \"Line C\". The beef, cod and shrimp raw material packages from the three southwestern provinces (respectively recorded as tasks A, B and C) must complete the three processes of initial cutting, deep freezing and packaging in sequence before they can be packed and shipped to supermarkets nationwide. The company's senior management requires that the total time required to complete the processing of all raw material packages should be shortened as much as possible while maintaining a smooth transportation network, reducing the cost of processing links and the waste of human resources, so as to catch up with the bulk trunk trains sent to East China every Wednesday night.\n**In terms of process**, the industry usually controls the \"ice coating rate\" of aquatic products at 6%-8% To reduce dehydration loss, each batch of raw material packages must first complete the initial cutting on assembly line A, then transfer to assembly line B for deep freezing, and finally transfer to assembly line C for packaging. The processing order must not be replaced, and each processing must be completed once before it can be completed, otherwise it will cause excessive bacteria and scrap. \n\nIn addition, in the process of initial cutting, deep freezing, and packaging, after a certain step is completed, you must wait for 0.5h (it takes 0.5h to move the product of a certain process to another assembly line, \n\nand it must be done during the working time of the assembly line, that is, between 6:00 and 20:00, but there is no need to wait after the packaging process is completed), and you must not enter the next process in advance without waiting time. \n\nThe three assembly lines can be started at the same time. \n\n At any time, assembly line A can only process one batch of raw material packages. If a batch has not completed the initial cutting, the remaining batches must wait. The order between them can be arbitrary, but more than two raw material packages cannot be processed at the same time. Assembly lines B and C also only process one batch of raw material packages at a time, and the order can be different from that of assembly line A, but a raw material package must be processed on assembly line A before it is placed on assembly line B, and the same applies to assembly line C. \n\nIn addition, the time period of the processing center is: the morning shift is from 6:00 to 20:00 every day, and there are only 14 hours of assembly line operation every day. \n **Completion time**, the three batches of raw material packages can only be packed and loaded after the assembly line C is finished. The company only cares about the last completion time of all batches, which is regarded as the construction period and is expected to be as small as possible. \nFaced with the tight delivery period, the dispatcher needs to give a start sequence plan for the three batches of raw material packages on the three assembly lines, that is, it must be specified which day, which time period, and which assembly line will process which raw material package. And give the minimum total construction period for all completions (starting from 0, in units of hours\t). If the construction period cannot be completed in one day, it can be postponed to the next day, and the longest construction period is three days. \n\nData table\n\n| Task | Assembly line A (initial cutting) processing time / h | Assembly line B (deep freezing) processing time / h | Assembly line C (packaging) processing time / h |\n| ----- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| A beef | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n| B cod | 2 | 4 | 1 |\n| C Shrimp | 4 | 3 | 2 |",

The company owns 100 hectares of arable land and mainly grows crops such as wheat, corn, soybeans and cotton. As market demand changes, management hopes to reasonably allocate the planting area of ​​various crops under limited land and resource conditions to maximize economic benefits. The company faces many challenges, including how to maximize the planting profits of different crops while ensuring the supply of labor, irrigation water and fertilizer resources. In addition, in order to adapt to the needs of soil nutrients and market diversification, management has put forward some specific requirements for the planting ratio of each crop. The company needs to ensure the optimal use of resources and reasonable crop allocation plans. Ensuring agricultural production not only meets market demand, but also ensures sustained economic benefits. \n\n**On the supply side**, the company has 100 hectares of arable land available for planting, but the land area required for each crop is different, and all land must be planted with crops without waste. The output profit per hectare of wheat, corn, soybeans and cotton is also different. Therefore, it is necessary to reasonably allocate limited arable land resources in order to achieve maximum profit. **On the transportation side**, considering soil nutrients, management requires that the planting area of ​​all crops shall not be less than 10 hectares, and the planting area of ​​wheat shall not be less than 20 hectares. The planting area of ​​cotton is limited and shall not exceed 30 hectares. In order to cope with the diversification of market demand, corn and cotton The total planting area shall not exceed 80 hectares. \n\nThe company is located in a mild climate area with good water source conditions, but the weather has changed greatly recently, and the supply of water resources may be affected to a certain extent, especially if the water consumption exceeds 80% of the total supply, the insurance mechanism will be triggered. If water resources are still needed, additional labor will be needed to transport water resources to facilitate timely replenishment of the remaining 20% ​​of water resources to irrigate the land without interference, and every 1 unit of irrigation water requires 2 units of labor, and in order to protect water resources, the use of water resources must not exceed the maximum limit. At the same time, fertilizers may also encounter the problem of insufficient fertilizers, which involves fertilizer transportation, which also needs to be purchased from outside Purchase. If for every additional unit of fertilizer consumed, 2 additional workers are needed to ensure normal purchase, a maximum of 20 tons of fertilizer will be consumed. The capital expenditure of the purchase part has nothing to do with the unit profit and does not need to be considered. \n\nAssume that a worker can provide 2 hours of labor. Currently, the company has recruited a total of 500 workers. In this area, it is necessary to choose how many workers to send to plant a certain crop, and the total labor of the workers cannot be less than the required labor. \n\nIn order to optimize the use of resources, the company hopes to allocate land resources to different crops as efficiently as possible and provide a dispatch plan for workers to different crops, but at the same time, it also needs to ensure that the various constraints specified are not violated.

In order to avoid coordination confusion, the joint order only requires two factories. In order to effectively utilize the production capacity and logistics resources of each factory and control production and transportation costs, the company hopes to optimize the assignment plan to assign each order to the appropriate factory to minimize the overall cost, while considering the limitations of resources such as manpower, equipment, and transportation, as well as factors such as incentive mechanisms. In this scenario, the production scheduling team needs to model the order-factory matching plan and formulate the optimal plan to guide subsequent production arrangements and performance evaluation.\n On the supply side, each factory has different annual production capacity and specialized production line characteristics.

As one of the demonstration projects, Chenxi Reservoir has introduced a zoned water transfer scheduling system for the first time. Different downstream areas will directly receive the water released from the reservoir. At the same time, in the new round of green energy transformation, the power generation efficiency of Chenxi Reservoir has been raised to the main assessment indicator, and water supply demand has become a basic premise that must be guaranteed.\n\nThe company has set up a new power generation reward mechanism: due to the high initial head and good power generation efficiency, the power generation in the first two periods is calculated as twice the water release; and the head decreases in the later period, the third and fourth periods are calculated as twice the water release. The power generation in a period is equal to the water release itself. In order to cope with the diversified regional water supply needs, Chenxi Reservoir needs to reasonably allocate the total water release according to the maximum demand limits of different regions, and avoid the system burden caused by excessive water supply in various regions. \n\nThe company hopes to formulate a scientific and reasonable four-period scheduling plan this time to **maximize the total power generation** and ensure that the water supply demand in the downstream area is not affected. \n\n**In terms of supply**, the current water volume of Chenxi Reservoir is 1 million cubic meters, with a fixed natural inflow in each period, and all the inflow enters the reservoir capacity. There is no natural loss during the dispatch period, and it can be dispatched freely, but it cannot be discarded or artificially increased. **In terms of demand**, downstream demand is divided into two areas, area A and area B, and each period has a corresponding maximum water supply demand limit. The sum of the actual water supply in each area should be equal to the current water release, and each shall not exceed the corresponding maximum demand limit. \n\n**In terms of transportation**, the total water release of the reservoir in each period shall not exceed 1 million cubic meters, and the water release must be greater than or equal to 0. The final inventory of the reservoir in each period is maintained between 0 and 2 million cubic meters. At the end of each period, The change in water volume must satisfy the water balance: that is, the reservoir storage is equal to the previous period's storage plus the current period's inflow minus the current total water release. \n\n**In terms of power generation**, the power generation of Chenxi Reservoir is directly related to the water release. In the first and second periods, the power generation is twice the water release, and in the third and fourth periods, the power generation is 1 times the water release.

The factory has a flexible multi-product mixed production line. The production department needs to formulate a monthly production plan based on market orders, and the finance department is responsible for calculating regular and overtime production costs and inventory holding costs, and providing decision-makers with low-cost, high-service production-inventory planning solutions. The group takes \"precise production and coordinated distribution\" as its overall strategic goal, and strives to optimize the allocation of production and inventory resources while meeting market demand. Now it is planning to customize a six-month plan. production plan. \n\nIn terms of supply, the regular production capacity of the Jinling factory for the four products is limited by product as shown in the following table. Overtime production can only be used when the total production of the item reaches the maximum. \n\nIn terms of demand, the monthly demand for the four products will be different in the next six months, but the sum of the demand for the four products in any month must be equal to the total market demand, and no product should be backordered at the end of the month. \n\nIn terms of inventory balance, a separate inventory account must be established for each product. The inventory at the end of the month is equal to the inventory of the previous month plus the sum of the regular production and overtime production of the current month minus the demand for the product in the current month, and all inventory at the end of the month must be non-negative. \n\n In terms of additional or priority constraints, after the regular production of product A is completed, the by-product can be recycled, and two additional products B can be produced for free; at the same time, since products AB are similar, the number of AB products produced is usually the same. However, if the actual production of product B exceeds the production of product A due to excessive demand for product B in a certain month, the excess will be regarded as a separate increase in production. When calculating the price of this part of product B, it is necessary to add 1 yuan per piece to the regular unit price of product B (in order to simplify calculations and encourage not to work overtime, regardless of whether the product B is produced during overtime, it is calculated based on the regular unit price of product B). \n\nIf the regular unit price of products C and D in a certain month is If the sum of the production volume and overtime production volume exceeds 40 pieces, starting from the next month, the regular monthly production capacity of both products C and D will be expanded to 36 pieces and all unit prices will be reduced by 1 yuan (overtime cost is also calculated by multiplying the unit price by 1.5 and then minus 1). \n\nAll production volumes and inventory volumes are integers greater than or equal to zero, and the initial inventory of each product is zero. The objective function is to minimize the sum of the regular production cost, overtime production cost, expansion cost and month-end inventory holding cost of each product within six months under the premise of satisfying the above constraints. \n\nPlease give the calculated total cost based on the above scenario and description. \n\nMonthly demand\n\n| Product \\ Month | January | February | March | April | May | June |\n| :---------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| A | 20 | 22 | 25 | 18 | 15 | 10 |\n| B | 30 | 28 | 35 | 32 | 25 | 20 |\n| C | 15 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 20 | 20 |\n| D | 15 | 20 | 30 | 20 | 10 | 10 |\n| **Total Dₜ** | 80 | 90 | 120 | 110 | 70 | 60 |\n\nMonthly production capacity\n\n| Parameter / Product or month | A | B | C | D |\n| :-------------------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Regular production capacity limit (pieces/month) | 30 | 30 | 20 | 20 |\n| Overtime production capacity limit (pieces/month) | 6 | 6 | 4 | 4 |\n| Regular production unit price (Yuan/piece) | 9 | 11 | 13 | 10 |\n| Overtime production unit price (Yuan/piece) | 13.5 | 16.5 | 19.5 | 15 |",

The company has many raw material suppliers and distribution centers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and is committed to providing high-quality panel solutions for the furniture manufacturing industry. The company's core factory is mainly responsible for cutting standard 100-unit length panels into various furniture components. In order to reduce production costs and save resources, it is necessary to manage the cutting plan in a refined manner to ensure that the panel waste is minimized and the delivery time is met. The overall goal is to minimize the use of panels while meeting customer order requirements, thereby reducing procurement and warehousing costs.\n\nABC Factory has built its own transportation network covering the whole country. The cut parts will be distributed to stores or end customers in various places through the logistics center. Before large-scale loading and distribution, the cutting plan must be optimized at the production end to ensure the efficient operation of the entire supply chain.\n\n**Detailed description of the problem**\n In terms of supply, the raw materials of the factory are sent to the factory by the company's suppliers on demand. The supply of boards is sufficient and the unit price is the same. In order to effectively control costs and resource utilization, it is necessary to reasonably plan the number of board uses for each cutting mode. The number of board uses cannot be negative to ensure physical feasibility. Factory 1 is responsible for modes 1, 2, and 3, and factory 2 is responsible for modes 4 and 5. Factory 2 must have at least one processing, and any factory must process any mode of wood three times before it can cut mode 6. \n\nIn terms of demand, according to market orders, 8 pieces of 25-unit length parts, 6 pieces of 40-unit length parts, and 4 pieces of 50-unit length parts need to be produced. The total number of parts of each length cut must at least match the order requirements to ensure customer delivery. \n\nIn terms of additional or priority constraints, in order to avoid employee fatigue due to excessive single-mode operation, each cutting mode can only be used for a maximum of three boards in the entire production process, and the number of boards in the selected cutting mode must be an integer because half a board cannot be cut and used. \n\n| Mode number $p$ | Cutting combination | Waste (unit) |\n| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------ |\n| 1 | 40 + 25 + 25 | 10 |\n| 2 | 40 + 40 | 20 |\n| 3 | 50 + 40 | 10 |\n| 4 | 50 + 25 + 25 | 0 |\n| 5 | 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 | 0 |\n| 6 | 50 + 50 | 0 |\n\n| Component length (unit) | Required quantity (pieces) | Profit (yuan) |\n| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------- |\n| 25 | 8 | 22 |\n| 40 | 6 | 31 |\n| 50 | 4 | 46 |\n\nFactory 1 can also break waste into synthetic wood, and synthetic wood can be used to make synthetic wood furniture.

Its Tiantian Workshop factory is responsible for the supply of snacks in many cities across the country. Due to the increase in market demand for light luxury desserts this year, the company has launched two new products based on the original product line, named Product I and Product II. The pre-sale response of these two new products across the country has been enthusiastic, especially Product I, which is expected to have high sales due to its unique taste.\n\nIn order to ensure smooth delivery, the factory cooperated with several large logistics companies to build a transportation network from the factory to major sales outlets. The transportation network design not only takes into account the transportation speed, but also introduces considerations of resource consumption and cost optimization. In addition, due to the long procurement cycle of raw materials, the factory's monthly supply of raw materials is currently limited. The company's senior management requires the production department to maximize this month's wholesale revenue while meeting supply constraints and sales expectations, while preparing for market expansion next month. Zhang made good production capacity and resource reserves. \n\nIn terms of supply, the monthly supply of raw materials A and B in the first month is 6 tons and 8 tons respectively, and the procurement costs of the two are 9,900 yuan/ton and 6,600 yuan/ton respectively. Each product consumes different amounts of raw materials during the production process.

        "question": "Manager Zhang, who is in charge of production at Hailong Auto Parts Factory, is considering how to train and reasonably arrange workers to reduce production costs. The factory produces three different types of auto parts, A, B, and C, and has six workers of different levels. Each worker works 40 hours per week. Due to the different complexity of parts, workers with different skills are required to complete them. For example, the production line of type A parts is the most complex, requiring workers of levels 1 to 3 to operate, the production line of type B parts is second, and the production line of type C parts has the lowest requirement for worker level. The current number of workers of different levels, hourly wages, and weekly time spent on each production line are shown in Table C-7.\n\nTable C-7\n\n| Worker level | Number of people | Wage (yuan/h) | A (h) | B (h) | C (h) |\n| :------: | :--: | :----------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | 4 | 15.0 | 160 | — | — |\n| 2 | 9 | 14.5 | 360 | — | — |\n| 3 | 20 | 13.0 | 600 | 200 | — |\n| 4 | 54 | 12.0 | — | 160 | 2000 |\n| 5 | 102 | 10.5 | — | 80 | 4000 |\n| 6 | 40 | 9.75 | — | — | 1600 |\n\nConsidering the changes in production tasks, Manager Zhang is training workers so that workers of different levels can work on the production lines of three types of accessories, A and B. \n\nWhether to train different workers to other production lines, training people requires different costs (the underlined part in Table 7 requires a one-time fee, and the more difficult and the lower the worker level, the higher the average training cost per person). The training cost table is as follows, and the part that does not need to be trained is replaced by 0. \n\n| Worker level | Training cost of line A (yuan/person) | Training cost of line B (yuan/person) | Training cost of line C (yuan/person) |\n| :------: | :------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------: |\n| 1 | 0 | 10 | 5 |\n| 2 | 0 | 20 | 5 |\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | 10 |\n| 4 | 15 | 0 | 0 |\n| 5 | 20 | 0 | 0 |\n| 6 | 25 | 20 | 0 |\n\n\n\nOf course, due to the differences in spare parts of A, B, and C, and the expertise of workers at different levels, the work efficiency of workers at different levels on different production lines is different. Table C-8 shows the work efficiency of workers at different levels on production lines A, B, and C. \n\nTable C-8\n\n| Worker level | A (pieces/h) | B (pieces/h) | C (items/h) |\n| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |\n| 1 | 2.00 | 1.20 | 2.00 |\n| 2 | 1.80 | 1.08 | 1.80 |\n| 3 | 1.62 | 2.50 | 1.62 |\n| 4 | 1.80 | 2.16 | 1.45 |\n| 5 | 1.62 | 1.93 | 1.31 |\n| 6 | 1.30 | 1.74 | 1.20 |\n\nIt is known that the demand for spare parts A, B, and C in each week of the next quarter is 1940, 1000, and 10060 pieces respectively. Manager Zhang preliminarily estimates that according to the current work schedule given in Table C-7 and the work efficiency given in Table C-8, the factory can be competent for the tasks of the next quarter, but the result of such an arrangement is that there is no flexible free time, and the salary expenditure is not economical. Therefore, a better weekly work schedule for workers is needed (specifically, at which level the workers of each level work), so as to minimize the salary expenditure for the tasks of the next quarter, and give the calculated total salary expenditure.

        "question": "Vice Chairman Song asked the finance, sales and production managers to come to his office to discuss the production quantity of tomato products in this production season. The tomatoes purchased according to the procurement plan this year have arrived at the processing plant and will start processing and production next Monday. Hong Mudan Canned Food Company is a medium-sized enterprise that produces and sells various canned fruits and vegetables. It has its own brand trademark in the Northeast. Financial Manager Qian Yuan and Sales Manager Xiao arrived at the office first.\n\nProduction Manager Liu arrived a few minutes late. He got the latest evaluation of the quality of the arrived tomatoes from the production inspector. According to the latest inspection report, according to the inspection report, about 20% of the 300,000 kg tomatoes are grade A, 70% are grade B, and the rest are grade C (score 1), and grade C can only be used to make tomato sauce. Tomato sauce can be produced from grade B and grade C tomatoes. At the same time, although grade C tomatoes are of lower quality , but it can be used to sell to the research department at 0.001 yuan/kg. How to improve the quality of C-grade tomatoes by research and development? If the sales volume is greater than 20,000 kg, there is an 80% chance of successful research and development, so that the remaining C-grade tomatoes that have not been sold to the research and development department can reach a C-grade quality of 4 points when making tomato sauce. If more than 10,000 kg of tomatoes are not sold (the same research and development is carried out when the sales volume is 0), then there is only a 20% probability of success. When we calculate, we take the average of the scores as the C-grade quality after research and development. \n\nVice President Song asked Xiao about the market demand for canned tomatoes next year. Xiao replied that according to the actual demand estimate, all the canned tomatoes produced by the company can be sold, but the demand for tomato juice and tomato sauce is limited and shown in Table C-10. He said that the sales price is set according to the company's long-term market strategy, and the potential sales demand is predicted based on these prices. \n\nTable C-10 Demand forecast and raw material usage\n\n| Product | Sales price (yuan/can) | Raw material usage (kg/can) | Demand forecast (can) ≤ |\n| :------- | :---------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: |\n| Whole tomatoes | 4.00 | 1.8 | 800000 |\n| Tomato juice | 4.50 | 2.0 | 50000 |\n| Tomato sauce | 3.80 | 2.5 | 80000 |\n\nAfter reading Xiao's demand forecast, Qian Yuan put forward his opinion. He believes that the company \"should use all tomatoes as much as possible for the production of whole canned tomatoes, and the production situation this year is quite good.\" With the help of the newly established accounting system, he can calculate the contribution of each product. According to his analysis, the profit of whole canned tomatoes is much higher than that of other tomato products. In May this year, Hong Mudan Company signed a tomato contract with professional growers at an average price of 0.6 yuan/kg. He also calculated the profit contribution of tomato products (see Table C-11). \n\nTable C-11 Product Profit Analysis Table (Unit: Yuan/Can)\n\n| Cost Category | Whole Tomatoes | Tomato Juice | Tomato Sauce |\n| :------------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |\n| Sales Price | 4.00 | 4.50 | 3.80 |\n| Direct Labor | 1.18 | 1.32 | 0.54 |\n| Variable Management Costs | 0.24 | 0.36 | 0.26 |\n| Variable Cost of Sales | 0.40 | 0.85 | 0.38 |\n| Packaging Materials | 0.70 | 0.65 | 0.77 |\n| Raw Materials | 1.08 | 1.20 | 1.50 |\n| Subtotal Variable Costs | 3.60 | 4.38 | 3.45 |\n| **Net Profit Per Can** | 0.40 | 0.12 | 0.35 |\n\nAt this time, Manager Liu reminded that although the company has sufficient production capacity, it is impossible to use all tomatoes to produce whole canned tomatoes because the proportion of tomatoes that reach Grade A quality is too small. Red Mudan Company uses numerical scores to evaluate the quality of tomatoes. According to the company's standards, the average score per kg of Grade A tomatoes is 9 points, and the average score of Grade B is 5 points. Liu Hua pointed out: The average score of the minimum feed for whole canned tomatoes is 8 points, tomato juice is 6 points, and tomato sauce is 4 points. Tomato sauce can be produced entirely from Grade B tomatoes. This means that whole canned tomatoes will be limited to less than 44,500 cans. Song Chiping believes that this is not a real constraint. He was asked to buy 80,000 kg of Grade A tomatoes at a price of 0.85 yuan/kg, and he rejected the bid request. However, he believes that those tomatoes are still available. \n\nWithout considering the purchase opportunity of 80,000 kg of Grade A tomatoes provided by the vice chairman, construct a linear programming model to help Red Mudan Company find the optimal production plan and give the maximum profit.

According to the White Paper on Social Services for the Silver Hair released by the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, the proportion of the city's population over 60 years old has exceeded the international standard for an aging society, and presents a distribution feature of \"dense urban areas and scattered suburban areas\". In response to this trend, the municipal government has launched the \"Sunset Red\" elderly care facility optimization project, planning to build a three-level elderly care service system. The project is currently in the first phase of planning, focusing on solving the problem of insufficient coverage of basic elderly care institutions. Due to the significant differences in geographical conditions among districts and counties - the central urban area has a highly concentrated population but tight land use, and the remote suburban counties have the pain point of too large a service radius, the project team needs to scientifically balance the efficiency of resource allocation and the principle of equalization of public services. This decision will directly affect the accessibility of elderly care services in the city, involving policy objectives such as the efficiency of the use of fiscal funds and regional coordinated development. The optimal site selection plan needs to maximize the coverage of the population under the constraints of a limited budget, and reserve expansion space for the subsequent second phase of the project. The implementation effect of the project will serve as a pilot case for provincial elderly care planning and provide a reference paradigm for similar cities. \n\nThe approximate locations and population numbers of the 20 districts and counties under Jinxiu City are shown in Figure C-13 and Table C34 respectively\n\nTable C-34 Number of residents in each district and county (unit: 10,000 people)\n\n| Code | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| Number of residents | 5.2 | 4.4 | 7.1 | 9.0 | 6.1 | 5.7 | 10.0 |\n| **Code** | **8** | **9** | **10** | **11** | **12** | **13** | **14** |\n| Number of residents | 12.2 | 7.6 | 20.3 | 30.4 | 30.9 | 12.0 | 9.3 |\n| **Code** | **15** | **16** | **17** | **18** | **19** | **20** | |\n| Number of residents | 15.5 | 25.6 | 11.0 | 5.3 | 7.9 | 9.9 | |\n\nAfter preliminary planning, it is planned to set up nursing homes in 10 points (①, ②, …, ⑩) in the figure, and each nursing home will serve the adjacent districts and counties.

The area was formed by land reclamation in the 1990s. Due to the obstruction of surrounding mountains and artificial lakes, the road network layout presents atypical characteristics. According to the \"White Paper on Commuter Transportation in the Harbor Area\" released by the Municipal Transportation Research Institute in 2023, there is an obvious tidal commuting phenomenon in the area: a large number of commuters flock from residential areas to employment centers during the morning rush hour, and the existing 4-5 main roads are too long. In order to alleviate congestion, the municipal government included the construction of lake ferries in the \"Three-Year Action Plan for Comprehensive Transportation Improvement\". The project needs to evaluate the diversion effect of ferry routes on existing land transportation. \n\n**Social significance: **\nThis transportation optimization plan directly affects the regional economic vitality and the quality of life of residents, involving core indicators such as improved commuting efficiency and reduced transportation costs.

Its core urban area presents a typical radial road network structure, and the main public facilities are distributed along the historical axis. According to the annual report on urban transportation development, the regional bus system undertakes more than 45% of the city's commuting travel needs, but there are structural problems such as overlapping routes and uneven resource allocation. In the latest plan, the Municipal Transportation Commission proposed a \"public transportation priority\" strategy, requiring the optimization of backbone routes connecting transportation hubs, educational and medical facilities and commercial areas. The 12 currently operating bus routes were formed in different historical periods. Some routes still retain the characteristics of commuting in industrial areas 20 years ago, which is not well matched with the current passenger flow distribution. This route optimization is a key link in the implementation of the \"Public Transportation Service Efficiency Improvement Plan\", which directly affects citizens' travel experience and urban carbon emission indicators. Scientific route adjustments can not only improve vehicle utilization efficiency, but also alleviate congestion on trunk roads during peak hours, and lay the foundation for the subsequent construction of smart bus systems.

        "question": "Magic Square is an ancient mathematical game that can be traced back to the records of the Luoshu in China in 1900 BC. This arrangement of filling consecutive natural numbers into a square matrix so that the sum of each row, column and diagonal is equal not only has mathematical aesthetic value, but also has a profound impact in cryptography, statistics and art design. Modern research shows that there are 8 basic solutions to the 3×3 magic square, and many variants can be derived through rotation and mirroring. In computer science, magic square generation algorithms are often used as benchmark cases for testing combinatorial optimization methods, and their constraint satisfaction characteristics are isomorphic to practical applications such as scheduling problems and resource allocation. This problem is essentially a typical constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), and its modeling ideas can be extended to engineering fields such as production scheduling and traffic flow balancing. Solving magic squares through integer programming can not only verify the inherent laws of mathematical symmetry, but also provide a method reference for dealing with more complex discrete optimization problems. Magic square research is still a classic case in the teaching of combinatorial mathematics and discrete optimization, reflecting the close connection between mathematical theory and applied practice. \n\nFill the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 into the 9 cells A, B, ..., H, I in Figure C-17, so that the sum of the numbers in each row, column and two main diagonals is 15. Try to establish an integer programming model and solve it. If the number in block A is 4, what is the number in block I? \n\nFigure C-17\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n| A | B | C |\n+---+---+---+\n| D | E | F |\n+---+---+---+\n| G | H | I |\n+---+---+---+\n```",
