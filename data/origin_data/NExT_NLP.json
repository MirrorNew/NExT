        "question": "In the field of large-scale infrastructure construction, the site selection optimization of concrete mixing plants is a key link to improve construction efficiency. A highway construction project department is facing a complex working condition of four sections being constructed at the same time. The concrete demand characteristics of each section are very different due to the different distribution of structures such as bridges and tunnels. When the engineering logistics team uses the weighted centroid method for site planning, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the coordinate data provided by the geographic information system and the phased consumption statistics of the material department. This spatial resource allocation problem is directly related to the balance between the tank truck scheduling cost and the concrete setting time. \n\nThe decision-making process involves the cross-application of construction organization design and operations research, and its methodology can also be extended to scenarios such as the site selection of urban emergency material reserve centers and the layout of regional cold chain logistics hubs. The general contractor of the project found in the scheme comparison that traditional empirical site selection often leads to increased transportation energy consumption, while scientific site selection based on quantitative models can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the supply chain, which is in line with the current green construction guidelines for the control of mechanical energy consumption. The supervision unit particularly emphasized that the site selection model needs to reserve a dynamic adjustment interface to adapt to the fluctuations in material demand caused by changes in construction progress. \n\nCurrently, the construction site has 4 work sites. The location of each work site and the amount of concrete required are listed in Table 6-2. Now it is necessary to build a central concrete mixing station to supply the concrete required by each work site. The total transportation volume of concrete (transportation volume Ã— transportation distance) is required to be minimum. If the roads from the mixing station to each work site are straight lines, try to determine the location of the mixing station. \n\nTable 6-2 \n\n| Location of work site | $(x_1,y_1)$ | $(x_2,y_2)$ | $(x_3,y_3)$ | $(x_4,y_4)$ |\n| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Required amount of concrete | $Q_1$ | $Q_2$ | $Q_3$ | $Q_4$ |\n\nAnswer: \n\nAssume that the location of the central concrete mixing station is $(x,y)$, then its location can be determined as follows.

Its products are mainly supplied to domestic chain home appliance stores and e-commerce platforms. As the demand fluctuations in the consumer market intensify, the production department faces the problem of optimizing the quarterly production plan. Due to the long adjustment cycle of the factory production line and limited storage space, management needs to balance capacity utilization and inventory costs. Supply chain analysts pointed out that overproduction will lead to a surge in storage costs, while insufficient production capacity may trigger the risk of contract breach and affect long-term cooperation with business partners. \n\nThis problem reflects the common production-inventory collaborative optimization challenges in the manufacturing industry. In the smart home appliance industry, the accelerated product iteration speed has increased the risk of inventory depreciation. Reasonable production plans can not only reduce operating costs, but also improve capital turnover efficiency. Huaxin Electronics is evaluating the introduction of dynamic programming algorithms to assist decision-making. This method has been successfully applied in the fields of automobile manufacturing and consumer electronics. The finance department is particularly concerned about the impact of this model on cash flow, because the requirement of zero inventory at the end of the quarter is directly related to the renewal conditions of the storage lease contract. \n\nThe TV factory needs to formulate a production plan for the next quarter. Due to the limitations of the factory's production capacity and warehouse size, its monthly production cannot exceed b units, and the storage volume cannot be greater than c units. According to the contract, the number of television sets that the factory needs to deliver to the commercial sector at the end of the i-th month is $d_i$. Now let $x_i$ and $y_i$ represent the number of television sets produced and stored by the factory in the i-th month, respectively. Its monthly production cost and storage cost are $f_i(x_i)$ and $g_i(y_i)$ respectively. Assuming that the storage volume at the end of this quarter is zero, try to determine the production plan (i.e. determine the monthly production volume) that minimizes the cost (including production cost and storage cost) of the next quarter, and give the calculated answer. \n\n**Input values:**\n\n- Production limit: $ b = 200 $ units/month\n- Storage limit: $ c = 100 $ units\n- Initial storage: $ y_0 = 0 $\n- Demand: $ d_1 = 150 $, $ d_2 = 200 $, $ d_3 = 212 $\n- Production cost function: $ f_1(x_1) = 100 x_1^{0.9} $, $ f_2(x_2) = 100x_2^{0.8} $, $ f_3(x_3) = 150x_3^{0.5} $\n- Storage cost function: g(y) = 20y",

        "question": "In large-scale bridge projects, the cross-sectional design of steel beams directly affects the load-bearing efficiency and material utilization of the structure. A design institute in Hainan found in a cross-river bridge project that the traditional rectangular cross-sectional beams have the problem of uneven stress distribution, and the cross-sectional parameters need to be optimized according to the principles of material mechanics. Structural engineers pointed out that under the constraints of a given circular steel billet, a reasonable selection of the aspect ratio can maximize the cross-sectional inertia moment, thereby improving the bending resistance. This optimization problem involves the coupled calculation of material strength theory and geometric constraints, and its methodology is also applicable to the design of load-bearing components such as high-rise building steel structures and heavy mechanical arms. \n\nBased on the technical specifications of the metallurgical industry, the optimized cross-sectional design must ensure that the edge fiber stress does not exceed the yield limit of the steel. The project supervisor pays special attention to the applicable boundary of the model, because the cross-sectional shape will also affect the fatigue life of the component under dynamic loads. The material laboratory is simultaneously conducting scaled model tests to verify the consistency between the theoretical calculation results and the actual force performance. \n\nAs the project progresses, the current engineers are paying attention to the following issues. There is a round stick with a radius of r, and we take r=300 meters. Now we want to cut a rectangular cross-section beam from the round stick (the cross-section size remains unchanged along the length of the beam). The cross-section size should maximize the bending moment that the beam can withstand.

Huaqiang Power Equipment Manufacturing Plant recently took on an order for quarterly delivery, facing the dual challenges of production scheduling and inventory management. Since there is an upper limit to the factory's production capacity and the production capacity is nonlinearly related to production costs, the production department needs to accurately plan the output of each quarter. The warehousing department pointed out that cross-quarter inventory not only occupies working capital, but also generates additional warehousing management costs, including warehouse maintenance, insurance costs and capital opportunity costs. \n\nThis problem reflects the supply chain optimization needs commonly faced by modern manufacturing companies. In the field of equipment manufacturing, production plan optimization can significantly reduce the company's operating costs while ensuring on-time delivery and maintaining the company's business reputation. Industry research shows that a reasonable production-inventory strategy can reduce the total cost of a manufacturing company by a considerable proportion. The finance department pays special attention to the impact of the model on cash flow, because the inventory level at the end of the quarter is directly related to the working capital demand and warehousing rental costs. At present, the plant is considering introducing a dynamic programming algorithm to assist production decision-making. This method has mature application cases in the fields of automobile manufacturing and aircraft engines. \n\nCurrently, the factory provides engines to users.

Lemiaoan Manufacturing Company plans to build a new distribution center to optimize its cargo distribution process to four major customers. Traditional warehouse location models are usually based on minimizing the total transportation distance or turnover, but in actual operations, transportation costs are often not simply linearly related to distance. For example, longer-distance transportation may involve higher fuel consumption, more complex route planning, or additional transit costs, so it is necessary to introduce an empirical correction factor to make the model closer to actual operations. \n\nThe company referred to domestic and foreign logistics optimization cases, such as JD Logistics' warehousing network planning in North China, which also used nonlinear cost functions to optimize distribution efficiency.

For example, Rhode Island Technology High Pressure Vessels, a well-known gas equipment manufacturer in Terra, recently undertook a project to provide high-pressure containers for new energy hydrogen energy storage systems. Such containers need to operate stably and for a long time under extreme pressure while meeting strict cost control requirements. Due to the high permeability and flammability of hydrogen, the structural strength and sealing of the container are particularly important, and the material thickness, welding process and volumetric efficiency must be considered comprehensively during design. The company's engineering team is optimizing the design based on industry standards to balance safety and economy, ensuring that while meeting volume requirements, the material and welding costs are minimized. The solution to this problem not only affects the economic benefits of a single project, but may also provide a standardized reference for the design of similar high-pressure vessels. \n\nSpecifically, Rhode Island engineers need to design a cylindrical pressure vessel (with hollow hemispherical heads at both ends) for storing high-pressure gas. The inner radius of the cylinder is known to be 10. The design variables include the thickness of the cylinder wall, the thickness of the head wall, and the length of the cylinder section. The container needs to meet the restrictions of the safety regulations for high-pressure gas storage. The wall thickness of the head must be more than five times the wall thickness of the cylindrical body, and the wall thickness of the cylindrical body must not be less than one thousandth of the length of the cylindrical section.

The unit volume cost of the given material is 1, and there is no need to consider the material cost of welding. The welding cost includes longitudinal welds and circumferential welds. The longitudinal weld is welded around the inner and outer edges of the cylindrical material, while the material of the welded part of the cylinder thickness is negligible due to its small length. The circumferential weld only considers the outermost edge of the welded cylinder, and require welding at both ends.

        "question": "In the field of industrial automation, the shock absorption system of precision mechanical equipment has strict requirements on spring performance. Bosch Rexroth, a well-known industrial transmission equipment manufacturer in Kazdel, recently developed a buffer device for its new generation of high-precision CNC machine tools, and needed to customize a batch of high-performance compression springs. This type of spring needs to balance the load capacity, fatigue resistance and dynamic stability in a limited installation space, while meeting the lightweight requirements to reduce the inertia of the equipment. Since the machine tool spindle will produce periodic vibrations when running at high speed, the natural frequency of the spring must avoid the working frequency band, otherwise the resonance may cause a decrease in positioning accuracy or even structural damage. In addition, the production line has extremely high requirements for spring consistency, and the parameter tolerance of each batch of products must be controlled within 5%, which requires that the material properties, process limitations and working condition boundary conditions must be comprehensively considered in the design stage. \n\nSpring design is essentially a multi-objective constrained optimization problem, involving the intersection of material mechanics, vibration theory and geometric topology. Taking the automobile suspension spring as an example, Tesla has adopted a similar approach in the lightweight design of Model 3. By adjusting the wire diameter, median diameter and effective number of turns, the weight of the suspension system was reduced while ensuring NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) performance. The constraints in this case reflect typical engineering trade-offs: the winding ratio restriction affects both the stress concentration factor (which needs to be calculated using the Wahl correction formula) and the feasibility of the coil spring process; while the outer diameter constraint is directly related to installation compatibility. The dynamic frequency requirement introduces the mass-stiffness coupling effect, and the system's natural frequency needs to be adjusted to move away from the excitation frequency. \n\nBosch Rexroth engineers plan to design a steel cylindrical helical spring for bearing compressive loads. It is known that the shear modulus of steel is $G = 11.5 \\times 10^6 $ and the material density is $\\rho = 0.284$. In addition, based on industrial requirements, the following practical conditions must also be met. In terms of safety, under the working load $ F_{\\text{work}} = 300 \\, \\text{lbf}$, the shear stress of the steel wire must be lower than the allowable value $ \\tau_{\\text{allowable}} = 80,\\!000 \\, \\text{psi} $, and the stress concentration effect caused by the spiral curvature must be taken into account; Second, considering the special dynamic performance of the spring, the natural frequency of the spring must be less than $F_{\\text{work}} = 4 \\, \\text{Hz}$ to avoid resonance; In addition, the compression of the spring must not be less than $\\delta_{\\text{allowable}} = 0.5 $ to ensure that the spring deformation is within the allowable range; Fourth, due to the strict limitation of the installation space of the spring and the need to ensure manufacturing processability, the winding ratio of the spring needs to satisfy $C = D/d$, which must be between 4 and 12, and the total outer diameter of the spring must be less than 1.5. The wire diameter needs to be between 0.1 and 0.5, and the spring center diameter needs to be between 0.5 and 6.0. Assuming that the weight is proportional to the volume of the spring and the proportional constant is 1, the effective number of coils and the support rings at both ends are included in the calculation of the total number of coils. The wire diameter, the middle diameter of the spring and the number of effective coils of the spring are reasonably designed to minimize the weight of the spring. \n\n**Appendix: Formula Symbol Table**\n\n| Symbol | Value | Meaning | Unit |\n| --------------------------- | ------ | -------------- | ---- |\n| $d$ | - | Wire diameter | inch |\n| $D$ | - | Spring center diameter | inch |\n| $N$ | - | Number of effective coils | - |\n| $F_{\\text{work}}$ | 300 | Working load | lbf |\n| $\\tau_{\\text{allowable}}$ | 8e4 | Allowable shear stress | psi |\n| $G$ | 11.5e6 | Shear modulus | psi |\n| $\\rho$ | 0.284 | Material density | inÂ³ |\n| $f_{\\text{max}}$ | 4 | Maximum natural frequency | Hz |\n| $\\delta_{\\text{allowable}}$ | 0.5 | Minimum allowable compression | inch |\n\n**Appendix: Related formulas**\n\n1.

        "question": "Against the backdrop of the rapid development of the construction industry, the Kazdale Reconstruction Commission Architectural Design Institute has undertaken the structural design task of the commercial complex project in Wishdale. The project is located in the core area of â€‹â€‹the city and includes a super high-rise tower and podium commercial facilities. As the person in charge of the project's structural design, Engineer Wang Weina is reviewing the design plan for the standard layer beam components in the podium area. This type of commercial building usually adopts a reinforced concrete frame structure. The design of the beam components not only needs to meet the requirements of bearing capacity and deformation, but also needs to consider economic efficiency, because such projects often involve tens of thousands of square meters of building area, and a small optimization of material costs can bring significant economic benefits. At the same time, with the construction industry's emphasis on sustainable development, the efficient use of materials has also become an important consideration in design. \n\nAmong them, the design plan for standard span precast concrete beams needs to be optimized. The institute's structural engineer team is using the limit state design method to conduct economic comparisons on the premise of meeting the requirements of the current \"Urban Reinforced Concrete and Prestressed Concrete Bridge and Culvert Design Code\". Considering that the precast beam needs to meet the design bending moment of 200kNÂ·m and control the construction cost, the team adopted a combination of C30 concrete and HRB400 steel bars to reduce material costs by adjusting the matching relationship between the cross-sectional size and the reinforcement ratio. Due to the large-scale prefabrication demand on the construction site, this optimization design has significant significance for the budget control of municipal engineering. \n\nDesign a simply supported reinforced concrete beam, including the width $b$ of the rectangular section, the effective height (section height minus the thickness of the protective layer) $h$ and the steel cross-sectional area $A_s$. For safety reasons, the range of the width and effective height of the rectangular section is $[200,,1000]$, and the steel cross-sectional area cannot exceed 20000. At the same time, the following constraints must be met. The bending bearing capacity is not less than the maximum bending moment that the beam can resist. The single-reinforced rectangular section is only equipped with tensile steel bars (no compressive steel bars), and the tensile force of the tensile steel bars is equal to the pressure in the concrete compression zone. Simplifying the actual nonlinear compressive stress distribution of concrete into a rectangular block with a height of a and a uniform stress of $k*f_c^{'}$ (the coefficient k is a correction to the actual strength of concrete), the tensile arm is $z = h - \\frac{a}{2}$. The calculation formula of the known internal force arm is $z = h - \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{A_s f_y}{k f_c' b} $, and the theoretical bending bearing capacity considering the safety factor $\\phi$ is $M_n = \\phi A_s f_y \\cdot z $. At the same time, to prevent the beam from brittle failure due to insufficient steel bars after concrete cracking, the steel reinforcement ratio should not be lower than the minimum reinforcement ratio. The steel reinforcement ratio calculation formula is $\\rho=\\frac{A_s}{b \\,h}$. Other material parameters are as follows: concrete compressive strength $f_c'=30$ MPa, steel yield strength $f_y=400$ MPa, design maximum bending moment $M_{req}=200$ kNÂ·m, resistance coefficient $\\phi=0.9$, minimum reinforcement ratio $\\rho_{min}= 0.035$, and correction factor $k= 0.85$ for actual concrete strength. The material cost of the beam is related to the cross-sectional area of â€‹â€‹concrete and steel, and the cross-sectional area is proportional to the cross-sectional area. The proportional coefficient is 1. Assuming that the cost of steel is about 15 times that of concrete, please design the steel parameters to minimize the cross-sectional cost and give the calculated cost value.",

This strategy not only improves the service experience of high-unit-price orders, but also maintains operational efficiency through a refined cost-shifting mechanism. Instant retail platforms such as JD.com also use similar algorithms to simulate the real-time utility of different product combinations on the user shopping interface and provide consumers with personalized recommendation solutions.

With the surge in air conditioning load in summer and the increased volatility of renewable energy power generation, the optimization and dispatch of traditional thermal power units faces greater challenges. The regional power grid is connected to multiple coal-fired units with different technical parameters. Unit 1 is the main unit that has been in service for many years, Unit 2 uses a new combustion technology, and Unit 3 is a flexible unit with rapid peak-shaving capabilities. The power generation efficiency curve of each unit is significantly different due to the age of the equipment, fuel type and maintenance status. \n\nAt the same time, the provincial energy regulatory department requires the dispatch center to strictly implement environmental emission standards and economic dispatch principles while meeting the reliability of power supply.

With the implementation of the Regional Air Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations, the three companies are required to coordinate emission reductions, but each faces different technical transformation difficulties: textile factories can achieve emission reductions by replacing low-pollution dyes, but marginal costs rise rapidly; heavy industry companies need to upgrade waste gas treatment equipment, with large initial investments; chemical plants have the highest emission reduction costs due to complex processes.

        "question": "In the logistics industry, optimizing transportation costs is one of the core challenges of supply chain management. Many large retail companies, such as Rhode Island Pharmaceuticals or Rhein Life Pharmaceuticals, face the problem of how to efficiently allocate inventory to meet customer needs in different regions. As the transportation volume increases, the cost often increases nonlinearly, which may be caused by vehicle load restrictions, reduced fuel efficiency, or congestion effects on transportation routes. For example, when a truck is close to full, the transportation cost of each additional unit of goods will increase significantly, and this phenomenon can be approximately modeled by a quadratic function. By analyzing the cost structure of transportation paths from different warehouses to customers, logistics optimization algorithms are able to develop the most economical distribution plan, thereby reducing overall operating costs. \n\nRhode Island Pharmaceuticals uses a similar transportation optimization model in its Kazdale distribution network. The company has two main regional warehouses in Dongguo and Longmen, which are responsible for distributing electronic products to customers in Wishdale City and Huatian City. Due to the differences in fuel prices, tolls, and transportation efficiency of different transportation routes, Rhode Island Pharmaceuticals uses a quadratic cost function to more accurately estimate transportation costs. For example, the transportation cost from the Dongguk warehouse to the customers in Huatian City will increase rapidly as the freight volume increases, reflecting the impact of highway congestion and additional dispatching costs. Through mathematical optimization technology, the shipment volume of each warehouse can be dynamically adjusted to ensure that the overall logistics cost is minimized while meeting customer needs and improving operational efficiency. \n\nA company has 2 warehouses (sufficient supply) supplying 2 customers.

Customers 1 and 2 have demands of 80 and 70 units respectively, and the maximum supply of warehouses 1 and 2 is 100 units each.

        "question": "In the fast-moving consumer goods retail industry, inventory optimization is a key challenge to balance supply and demand. Large supermarket chains such as Carrefour and Walmart usually use the economic order quantity (EOQ) model to manage the replenishment strategy of tens of thousands of products. Taking fresh food as an example, due to its short shelf life and large demand fluctuations, frequent small-batch orders can reduce inventory losses, but will lead to higher logistics and procurement costs; while large-batch orders can reduce the cost of a single purchase, but may increase storage pressure and expiration risks. Storage space restrictions further exacerbate this contradiction, especially for larger products such as beverages or toilet paper, whose storage space occupancy will significantly affect the overall inventory strategy. Modern retail companies usually use dynamic optimization algorithms to calculate the optimal replenishment cycle and batch size for different categories while meeting shelf space constraints. \n\nAccording to this, Rhode Island Warehouse Convenience Store reconstructed the inventory management model through real-time sales data (POS) and AI prediction systems.

Historical data show that when the traffic volume on a road exceeds the design capacity, the actual travel time will show a superlinear growth due to vehicle interaction - this is highly consistent with the modified form of the BPR function of the Federal Highway Administration of Colombia. Actual measured data in the winter of 2023 showed that the 35-minute journey predicted by the navigation software often takes an additional 7% of time in actual travel. This difference is mainly due to ramp merging conflicts and driving behavior variations. \n\nBased on this phenomenon, Amap upgraded its dynamic path recommendation engine in 2024. The new system no longer simply guides users to the instantaneous \"fastest path\", but adopts the Wardrop equilibrium principle to calculate the optimal vehicle ratio of each path through a distributed algorithm.

Due to the differences in propagation characteristics of different frequency bands, the 3.5GHz band has a smaller coverage range but can provide higher data rates at the same power; while the 2.6GHz band has a wider coverage but relatively low spectrum efficiency. This difference is similar to the gain coefficient of different channels in the title. \n\nThe Massive MIMO solution provided by Rhode Island Information Company uses a similar Shannon capacity formula for power optimization. By real-time monitoring of the channel state information (CSI) of each frequency band, the system dynamically adjusts the power allocation to ensure that the network throughput is maximized under the total power limit.

Taking the Halcyon radiotherapy platform developed by Varian Medical Systems as an example, its treatment planning system needs to consider the dose contribution of multiple beam angles at the same time. It is found in clinical practice that due to the differences in radiation sensitivity of different tissues, the dose limit of healthy tissues often requires stricter constraints than theoretical calculations-this explains why the exponent of healthy tissue dose in the actual specification function is adjusted from 2 to 2.05. \n\nClinical data from the Cancer Center of Rhode Island Medical Hospital show that in the treatment of prostate cancer, the risk of excessive doses of sensitive organs such as the rectum is three times the tumor control rate. Therefore, the planning system will give higher priority to normal tissue protection when optimizing. This clinical demand prompts the planning algorithm to reduce the dose of healthy tissue to below 20Gy as much as possible while ensuring the minimum tumor dose (such as 60Gy). In actual treatment, this optimization can reduce the incidence of rectal complications from 15% to 5%, while maintaining a tumor control rate of more than 90%. \n\nThis dose optimization problem originates from the concept of inverse treatment planning proposed in the 1990s. With the development of computer technology, modern radiotherapy systems can handle complex optimization problems with dozens of beam directions. The latest artificial intelligence-assisted planning systems, such as ViewRay's MRIdian, can also adjust the dose distribution in real time to adapt to organ movement during treatment, which can improve the protection of healthy tissue by about 20%. \n\nSpecifically, in the radiotherapy plan for a patient, there are 2 beams with adjustable intensity. The variables $x_1, x_2$ represent the irradiation intensity of beams 1 and 2. For human safety, the intensity of x1 must not be higher than 60 Gy. The tumor area dose $D_T = 0.8x_1 + 1.0x_2$ (requires at least 60 Gy), and the healthy tissue dose $D_O = 0.3x_1 + 0.6x_2$ (hopefully as low as possible and not more than 30 Gy). The specifications of tumor dose and normal tissue dose follow the approximate quadratic objective function: $f = (D_T - 60)^2 + (D_O)^2$, to simultaneously consider the constraints of tumor dose compliance and normal tissue dose control. However, in actual sampling, more specifications for healthy tissue dose are usually required to complete the reasonable screening of all tissues. The specification function is usually taken as $(D_O)^{2.05}$. The constraints include the minimum tumor dose and the upper limit of normal tissue dose, as well as the non-negative beam intensity.

The expected return function of the project can be approximated as $U(x)=A[1-e^{-kx}]$ (return unit: million), reflecting the marginal effect of diminishing returns on investment. Now the investment allocation goal for the two projects is to maximize the total return.

        "question": "In the renewable energy layout of the Northwest Branch of Kazdel National Energy Group, similar problems of optimizing the allocation of power generation resources are faced. The wind energy resources in the suburban areas are abundant, but limited by the power grid's absorption capacity, the marginal power generation benefits of wind farms will decrease significantly with the increase of installed capacity; in contrast, although the local photovoltaic power generation has a stable output per unit investment, it needs to build a supporting energy storage system to balance the difference in output during the day and night. \nThis investment optimization model reflects the typical characteristics of new energy development: wind power has a first-mover advantage but is limited by resource endowment, while photovoltaic power faces nonlinear growth in system costs. The practice of the Rhode Island Group in Kazdel shows this. Based on this, modern energy planning software usually introduces such nonlinear constraints into the traditional production function to more accurately simulate the efficiency loss in the actual system. \n\nCurrently, a certain area in Kazdel plans to allocate up to 10 billion yuan of investment to wind power ($W$ billion) and photovoltaic ($P$ billion) construction to maximize annual power generation. The annual power generation of wind farms decreases marginally with the increase of investment, which can be approximated as $F(W) = 5W - 0.01W^2$ (billion kWh); photovoltaic power generation is approximately proportional to investment $S(P) = 10P$ (billion kWh), but an additional fixed 5 units of power generation is required as startup energy. In addition, if the investment exceeds 2 billion yuan or more in photovoltaic power generation, a large amount of power generation will be consumed as the electricity for infrastructure construction. The power generation of this part and the amount of the excess part are in a standard quadratic relationship, that is, the coefficient is 1. The design variables are the investment amounts of wind power and photovoltaic power $W, P$ (billion yuan). The total power generation is wind power and photovoltaic power generation $F(W)+S(P)$ minus the consumed startup energy and electricity consumed for infrastructure construction. The total power generation is expected to be the largest. ",

Taking the Kazdale Energy Grid as an example, although its coal-fired units (similar to power source 1) have a low basic power generation cost, the coal consumption characteristic curve shows an obvious quadratic growth feature; while the gas turbine (similar to power source 2) has a fast startup speed, but the fuel cost rises faster with the increase in output. During the peak summer period in 2023, the dispatchers found that when the transmission distance exceeds 200 kilometers, the line loss will significantly affect the economy of the entire network, and it becomes a nonlinear loss, which is highly consistent with the simulation results of the IEEE 14-node standard test system. \n\nModern power system optimization has developed from the traditional linear DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) to the AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) considering network losses. The intelligent dispatching system adopted by the Kazdale Power Grid updates the network loss coefficient in real time through online state estimation, and controls the economic dispatch error within a very small number. Compared with traditional methods, this refined dispatching method can save about 120 million yuan in fuel costs each year and reduce carbon emissions by 0.3%. The latest research is trying to integrate deep learning prediction into loss calculation to cope with the uncertainty brought by the access of renewable energy. \n\nFor this situation, there is now a simple power network with two power sources and one load node.

Taking the North Fourth Ring Road (Road A) and the Beijing-Chengde Expressway (Road B) connecting the main east road CBD of Theresia City as examples, the two parallel main roads face exactly the same traffic allocation challenges during the morning rush hour on weekdays. Traffic engineering observation data show that when the traffic volume of the North Fourth Ring Road exceeds 900 vehicles/hour (i.e. 90% capacity), the ramp merging conflict will cause the actual travel time to increase slightly compared to the theoretical value, which is highly consistent with the additional waiting time setting in the question. The actual measured data of the Beijing Transportation Development Research Institute in 2023 show that this nonlinear delay characteristic is common in the expressway system, and the increase in travel time will increase several times for every 10% increase in traffic density. \n\nAmap uses a similar user equilibrium model in the navigation algorithm upgraded in 2024. The system dynamically adjusts the path recommendation strategy by monitoring the vehicle occupancy rate of the two alternative paths in real time. In specific implementation, the algorithm not only considers the congestion situation at the current moment, but also predicts the time point when the traffic reaches 90% capacity based on historical data. Practical application shows that this active balancing strategy shortens the average travel time during the morning rush hour in the East Third Ring Road area of â€‹â€‹Beijing by 8.3%, while stabilizing the road capacity utilization rate in the optimal range of 85-89%. It is worth noting that when the system detects that a road is about to reach critical capacity, it will start to guide vehicle diversion in advance. This predictive control can reduce some additional delay time compared to passive response scheduling. \n\nSpecifically, there are now two parallel roads A and B for Theresia City in Kazdel that can lead from the same starting point to the end point. During peak hours, a total of 2,100 vehicles need to be distributed on the two roads. The idle driving time of Road A is about 10 minutes, and that of Road B is about 12 minutes; when congested, the travel time will increase with the square of the flow rate. Specifically, the travel time of Road A is $T_A=10+0.0001f_A^2$ (minutes), and that of Road B is $T_B=12+0.00008f_B^2$, where $f_A,f_B$ are the number of vehicles allocated to Roads A and B, respectively. If the number of vehicles on a road reaches 90%, there will be an additional 5% waiting time on the original basic travel time. Roads AB can accommodate up to about 1000 and 1200 vehicles respectively. Assuming that the travel time of all vehicles on any road is the same, it is necessary to determine the number of vehicles $f_A$ assigned to road A (the rest will take road B) to minimize the sum of the total travel time of all vehicles.",

Taking COSCO Shipping Group's VLCC (very large crude carrier) as an example, ships face differentiated operational constraints in different sections: although the first section has the longest distance, the relatively loose speed limit and low fuel prices provide adjustment space for economic speed; while the second section, although the shortest distance, becomes a key node for cost control due to the narrow channel and high fuel prices. Actual operating data shows that when the speed exceeds 50km/h, the additional fuel consumption caused by the wave resistance of the hull. The analysis of shipping big data in 2023 shows that the implementation of segmented speed optimization in the Strait of Malacca can save some fuel costs compared with fixed speed. \n\nModern ship energy management systems (such as WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤'s ENGS) use dynamic programming algorithms to handle such multi-segment optimization problems. The system will comprehensively consider the distance, fuel price, speed limit and ETA requirements of each section, and calculate the optimal speed profile that meets the total time constraint. In actual applications, when it is predicted that a high fuel price segment is about to be entered, the system will recommend appropriate speed increase in the first segment to gain more economical speed time. The evaluation report of the Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO) shows that this segment optimization strategy can improve the average fuel efficiency of the Singapore-Europe route while maintaining the on-time arrival rate above the average. The latest AI speed optimization system can also integrate environmental data such as ocean currents and weather in real time to further control the fuel consumption prediction error within a reasonable range. \n\nSpecifically, a cargo ship needs to cross three sections of the Strait of Malacca, and the characteristics of each section are as follows:\n\n| Section | Distance (km) | Fuel price (yuan/ton) | Maximum speed limit (km/h) |\n| ---- | -------- | --------------- | -------------- |\n| 1 | 200 | 3000 | 70 |\n| 2 | 100 | 3500 | 60 |\n| 3 | 150 | 4000 | 80 |\n\nThe average fuel consumption rate per kilometer increases significantly with the increase of speed, showing a quadratic relationship, and the fuel consumption coefficient is 0.005 tons/(${km}^2$/h). If the ship speed exceeds 50km/h, due to the increase in water resistance, the fuel consumption needs to exceed the square of the speed difference on the basis of the original fuel consumption, and the fuel consumption coefficient is 0.0001 tons/(km^2/h). In order to save fuel costs, it is necessary to determine the optimal speed, and the speed of each different section should remain unchanged. Minimize fuel consumption costs while ensuring that the sailing time does not exceed 10 hours.

Taking the air conditioning business of Rhode Island Electric Group as an example, its production bases in Foshan (factory 1) and Wuhu (factory 2) serve the two major regional markets of East China (market 1) and South China (market 2) respectively. Production data show that due to the high degree of automation, the unit cost of the Foshan factory shows significant economies of scale as the output increases; while the Wuhu factory has higher fixed costs, but is more flexible in small batch production. The 2023 supply chain audit report shows that this nonlinear cost structure leads to a unique exponential characteristic of the total cost function, which is highly consistent with the mathematical model in the title. \n\nJD Logistics needs to accurately balance production scale benefits and transportation costs when designing regional distribution plans for home appliance customers. Its intelligent scheduling system uses a mixed integer programming model to dynamically optimize the factory-market distribution combination while meeting the needs of distribution centers in each region. In actual operation, the system will give priority to the low-cost transportation channel from Foshan to Guangzhou (similar to factory 1 to market 2), even if this means that the Foshan factory needs to break through the optimal economic output. Operational data from 2024 shows that this integrated optimization solution that takes economies of scale into account can reduce overall supply chain costs and increase order fulfillment rates compared to the traditional separate decision of production first and distribution later. \n\nModern supply chain management systems (such as SAP IBP) can handle more complex nonlinear cost functions.

        "question": "In the precision irrigation system of Netafim, the agricultural technology branch of the Rhode Island Group, similar resource allocation problems are transformed into mathematical optimization models. Data from the experimental farm on the south bank of Theresa Bay show that there are significant differences in the response curves of tomato planting areas (field 1) and pepper planting areas (field 2) to fertilizer: tomato yield is less sensitive to fertilizer, and each additional kg of fertilizer only brings diminishing marginal yield benefits; while pepper crops have a significant initial yield increase effect, but when the fertilizer application exceeds the critical value (about 80 kg/hectare), the salinization caused by the increase in soil EC value will reduce the yield. \nThe National University of Colombia has developed a decision support tool similar to Netafim in the wheat-corn rotation system in the North China Plain. The system monitors the fertility of the field in real time through soil sensors. When it detects that the fertilizer application in a field is close to the threshold, it automatically allocates excess fertilizer to the field with a flatter response curve. Field trials in 2023 showed that this dynamic optimization allocation method can increase total yield while reducing fertilizer waste compared to uniform fertilization. It is worth noting that in practical applications, the differences in fertilizer requirements of different crop varieties must also be considered - for example, the fertilizer utilization efficiency of corn is usually 20-30% higher than that of wheat, which prompts modern precision agriculture systems to integrate crop growth models for multi-dimensional optimization. \n\nThe assessment report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) pointed out that after the promotion of this type of optimized fertilization model in rice-growing areas in Southeast Asia, it not only increased yields, but also reduced nitrogen fertilizer runoff pollution by 25%. The latest research is trying to incorporate soil health indicators such as organic matter content and microbial activity into the objective function so that the optimization results can not only guarantee the current yield, but also maintain the sustainable production capacity of the land. \n\nNow, Kazdale Farm has two fields, which have introduced the irrigation system of the Rhode Island Group Agricultural Technology Branch, which can allocate a total of 150 kilograms of fertilizer for crop fertilization. Fields 1 and 2 can apply a maximum of 100 and 90 kilograms of fertilizer respectively. Crop yield $y$ and fertilizer input $x$ show diminishing marginal returns. For example, the yield function of field 1 is $y_1=5\\sqrt{x_1}$, and field 2 is $y_2=6\\sqrt{x_2}$ (yield unit: tons). Assuming that the yield depends only on the amount of fertilizer input in the season, and because too much fertilizer input will lead to a reduction in the yield of Field 2, Experience shows that if Field 2 exceeds 90 tons, it is easy to lead to a reduction in land yield. The amount of reduction in yield is in a square relationship with the amount of fertilizer input to Field 2, with a coefficient of 0.00002, and the other conditions are the same. Farmers hope to maximize the total yield $y_1+y_2$ by reasonably allocating fertilizers $x_1,x_2$.",

Taking the mineral disease product line of Rhode Island Media as an example, its annual advertising budget needs to be allocated between TV (channel A), social media (channel B) and radio (channel C). Market data analysis shows that although traditional TV advertising has the highest unit input-output ratio, it has a saturation threshold of 600,000 yuan; while social media advertising, although the initial benefits are low, can obtain stable marginal benefits through precise delivery. It is particularly noteworthy that when a channel becomes the \"lowest input channel\", the company will launch the \"effect amplifier\" strategy - expanding the budget of the channel by 3 times for concentrated delivery. This strategy stems from the A/B test that found that after the weak channel is strengthened, its marginal benefit curve will show a phased improvement. The 2023 marketing effect evaluation shows that the brand that adopts this dynamic adjustment strategy has a 18.7% lower customer acquisition cost than the fixed budget allocation model. \n\nThe Rhode Island Media platform handles this type of optimization problem through the marketing mix model (MMM). The system will track the input-output elasticity coefficient of each channel in real time. When a channel is identified as a \"long-tail channel\", the budget reallocation mechanism will be automatically triggered. In practice, this optimization needs to take into account the channel synergy effect - for example, the increase in brand awareness brought by TV advertising will greatly increase the conversion rate of social media advertising. The latest artificial intelligence system can also predict the cross-channel impact after the budget adjustment, and control the error of revenue forecast within a reasonable range. According to the benchmark report of MMA China, the average marketing ROI of enterprises using nonlinear budget optimization models is much higher than the industry level. Especially in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, companies such as Unilever have begun to incorporate external variables such as market saturation and the intensity of competitive product activities into the revenue function to build a more complex multi-objective optimization model. This evolution has enabled budget allocation to develop from a simple mathematical calculation to an intelligent decision-making system that integrates market dynamics. \n\nRhode Island Media plans to allocate a 100 units yuan advertising budget to three media channels (such as TV, Internet, and radio).

Experimental data show that at 80Â°C and 50% concentration, the yield reaches the theoretical peak of 100 kg/batch, but when it deviates from the optimal conditions, the yield will decrease as a quadratic function. However, in actual operation, temperature control is not a linear problem - when the temperature approaches 100Â°C, the heat exchange efficiency of the reactor decreases and the difficulty of operation increases sharply (in line with the parabolic model). In addition, the combination of high concentration (>60%) and high temperature (>85Â°C) will significantly increase the generation of volatile by-products, leading to increased safety risks. \n\nModern chemical process control systems (such as Aspen Plus) can adjust parameters in real time and dynamically balance yield, energy consumption and safety. The introduction of deep learning models further improves the prediction accuracy of nonlinear interactions, making the optimization results closer to actual production needs. \n\n In a chemical reaction process, it is necessary to increase the yield by adjusting the reaction temperature and reactant concentration. Assuming other conditions are fixed, the reaction yield $Y$ can be approximately expressed as a function of temperature $T$ and concentration $C$: $Y(T,C)=100 - 0.01\\,(T-80)^2 - 0.02\\,(C-50)^2$ (unit: kg/batch).

It is hoped to find the optimal temperature $T$ and concentration $C$ settings to maximize the yield. However, in actual industrial operations, the difficulty of controlling the temperature from 50 degrees to 100 degrees has a certain marginal effect.

Taking the Siemens Flender reducer series as an example, its design team needs to consider the mutual influence of seven key dimensional parameters at the same time: although the increase in tooth width and module can improve the contact strength of the gear, it will significantly increase the weight; while the reduction in shaft diameter can reduce weight, it may cause the risk of bending failure. The latest revision of the German VDI standard in 2023 specifically emphasizes that for heavy-duty gear devices, the meshing strength coefficient must be controlled within the specified safety range. \nThe optimization module of ANSYS Workbench uses parametric modeling methods to deal with such complex problems. By coupling the tooth contact analysis (FEA) with the shaft dynamics simulation (MBS), the system can automatically evaluate millions of parameter combinations: the gear strength constraint is converted into a nonlinear function of the design variable through the ISO 6336 standard formula, the shaft strength calculation also considers the bending-torsion composite stress (based on the Tresca criterion), and the weight objective function corresponds to: gear mass (including tooth form coefficient), shaft segment weight reduction hole effect, shaft end flange contribution, Rolls-Royce has verified in the design of aviation gearboxes that this integrated optimization method can reduce weight and improve fatigue life compared to traditional trial and error design. \n\nNow, the mechanical design of the current reducer device requires the optimization of multiple dimensional parameters to reduce weight.

The power station dispatching center needs to balance the relationship between power generation benefits and the ecological water level of the reservoir: the ideal power generation condition during the flood season should be about 100 meters of head, and the head loss caused by the drop in water level will reduce the subsequent power generation efficiency. Actual operation data show that when the reservoir water level drops below 90 meters, the turbine efficiency curve has an inflection point-at this time, not only does the power generation decrease, but also additional energy is required to maintain the unit vibration within a safe range.

        "question": "In the petroleum refining industry, the choice of raw materials directly affects the quality and production cost of finished oil. Take the third refinery of Kazdel Petrochemical as an example. The plant needs to mix raw materials with different octane numbers to produce gasoline that meets the National VI standard. Although high-octane raw materials (such as catalytic reforming oil) can improve the anti-knock performance of gasoline, the procurement cost is high; while low-octane raw materials (such as straight-run gasoline) are cheaper, but require additional processing to meet the standards. Market data shows that when the mixed octane number is lower than 80, the combustion efficiency of gasoline decreases, which may cause engine knock, increase exhaust emissions, and even affect vehicle performance. Therefore, refineries need to optimize the raw material ratio to reduce costs while meeting the minimum octane requirements. \n\nModern supply chain management systems monitor the octane number and price of different crude oil sources in real time and automatically calculate the optimal mixing ratio. In actual operation, if the proportion of low-octane raw materials is too high, the system will trigger an alarm and recommend increasing the purchase of high-octane raw materials. The 2023 industry report shows that refineries using optimization models can reduce raw material costs by **5%~10%** compared to traditional empirical decisions, while ensuring that finished oil products meet 100% environmental standards. In addition, with the growing demand for low-carbon fuels, some companies have begun to introduce **carbon intensity constraints** to further optimize procurement strategies to reduce carbon emissions in the refining process. \n\nIn the **refining industry**, raw material procurement and optimization are key steps to ensure efficient and cost-effective production. In particular, in the production process, octane number (Octane Number) is an important indicator for measuring raw material quality, which directly affects the combustion performance, stability and safety of the final product. Raw materials with high octane numbers usually have higher combustion efficiency and lower pollution emissions, so they are widely used in the refining process. If the unit price of a production raw material A is 30, the quality index (in units of octane content/flow) is 90; the unit price of raw material B is 20, and the quality index is 70. In actual operation, the octane number requirement is usually to ensure that the final product (such as gasoline, fuel, etc.) meets market standards and safety standards. In order to meet production needs and take safety into consideration,the quality index cannot be less than 80; the total flow rate of the two raw materials must be equal to 1000 units; If the purchased raw material A exceeds 450 units, the unit flow of material A rate needs to be calculated using 1.05 power of the unit flow rate of purchased raw material A. Try to reasonably purchase the flow rate of the two raw materials to minimize the total cost of the raw materials. Give me the flow rate of A as final answer.",
