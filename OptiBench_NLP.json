The company needs to determine the number of trucks allocated to each type of goods and the number of trips per truck for each type of goods will make in the upcoming month. For ease of management, the number of trips per truck is the same for all trucks of the same type of goods. Additionally, the company wants to invest in fuel-efficient upgrades of trucks for each type of goods, which will reduce fuel costs per trip. The company has a total of 50 trucks available for the month. The total investment in fuel efficiency upgrades cannot exceed $60,000. Due to operational constraints, each truck can make no more than 20 trips in the month. The company must ensure that at least 10 trucks are allocated to GoodsX and 15 trucks to GoodsY. The fuel cost per trip for each type of goods decreases by $10 for every $10,000 invested in fuel efficiency upgrades for that type of goods. The initial fuel cost per trip for GoodsX is $200, for GoodsY is $250, and for GoodsZ is $300. The revenue generated per trip is $500 for GoodsX, $600 for GoodsY, and $700 for GoodsZ. The company aims to maximize the total profit from all goods.",

They need to decide how many development teams to allocate to each product for the upcoming quarter. For product APPY, the Estimated Revenue per Team is $150,000, the Development Cost per Team is $80,000, and the Marketing Cost per Team is $30,000. For product APPZ, the Estimated Revenue per Team is $200,000, the Development Cost per Team is $100,000, and the Marketing Cost per Team is $40,000. For product APPW, the Estimated Revenue per Team is $120,000, the Development Cost per Team is $70,000, and the Marketing Cost per Team is $25,000. For product APPV, the Estimated Revenue per Team is $180,000, the Development Cost per Team is $90,000, and the Marketing Cost per Team is $35,000. The company wants to maximize the average net profit per team. The company has a total of 30 development teams available for the quarter. Due to market research, the company knows that AppX must have at least twice as many development teams as AppY. The company has a budget of $2,500,000 for marketing costs for the quarter. The company wants to ensure that each product has at least one team working on it. For product APPX, the Estimated Revenue per Team is $100,000, the Development Cost per Team is $60,000, and the Marketing Cost per Team is $20,000.",

        "question": "A city is planning to install three types of renewable energy facilities: solar, wind, and hydro. The city needs to decide the number of each type of facility to build and the amount of land required for each facility. The goal is to maximize the total energy output while considering the available land and budget constraints. The city has a total of 100 acres of land available for the installation of these facilities. The city has a budget of $1000,000 for the construction of these facilities. The cost per solar facility is $10,000, per wind facility is $15,000, and per hydro facility is $20,000. The city aims to have at least 10,000 kWh of energy output per day. The city wants to ensure that at least 100 facility is installed. The energy output per solar facility is 500 kWh, per wind facility is 700 kWh, and per hydro facility is 1000 kWh. The city aims to maximize the total daily energy output from all facilities.",

        "question": "A manufacturing company produces three types of electronic devices: Smartphones, Tablets, and Laptops. The company needs to decide the production quantities for each device to optimize its resources and profits. The company has a limited supply of a critical component used in all devices, which is 1500 units. Each Smartphone requires 1 unit, each Tablet requires 2 units, and each Laptop requires 3 units of this component. There is a market demand constraint for each device. The maximum demand for Smartphones is 500 units, for Tablets is 400 units, and for Laptops is 300 units. The company has a total production capacity constraint of 1000 units across all devices. The profit per unit for Smartphones is $100, for Tablets is $150, and for Laptops is $200. Due to economies of scale, the profit per unit increases by $0.5 for each unit produced above 100 for each type of device. The company aims to maximize its total profit from the sales of these devices.",
